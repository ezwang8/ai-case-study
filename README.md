# Microsoft AI Analysis

## Overview and Origin

* **Name of the company**: Microsoft

* **When was the company incorporated?**: It was incorporated in 1975.

* **Who are the founders of the company?**: Bill Gates and Paul Allen.

* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**: 
    It started in 1975 when Bill Gates and Paul Allen were inspired by the potential of technology after reading a "Popular Electronics" magazine. It drove them to develop software for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer. Soon after, they founded Microsoft. The company name was created from the words microcomputer and software.

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**: 
    Microsoft earns its revenue by selling computing devices, cloud systems and services, software, and other products to consumers and businesses. Right now, the company has earned around $200 billion.

## Business Activities

* **What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**: 
    Microsoft's goal is to support people and businesses, in need of accessing the latest technology, by developing and distributing computing devices, cloud systems and services, software, and other products.

* **Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**:
    Microsoft's intended customer is essentially anyone who's interested in technology. To follow their company goal, Microsoft has a wide variety of products and services that can be advanced or accessible enough to satisfy any individual or group's situation in technology. But there are statistics found in 2023 that should be considered. Such as how 83% of all companies use Microsoft Office, the United States accounting for 34% of all Microsoft Office 365 users. But one interesting statistic states that 70% of Microsoft 365 users are in industries categorized as "Others." This shows that even unlisted professions, companies outside of business and tech, still populate more than two-thirds of the Microsoft user population. Therefore, Microsoft's intended customers generally depend on what product or service is being sold.

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**: 
    Microsoft has their own digital ecosystem which helps set them apart from the competition. The company invested in developing many interconnected apps and services which all have unique functions but are all equally important for users and businesses. For example, users would have Office 365 accounts to create PowerPoint presentations, write documents on Word, or save all of their data on OneDrive cloud. While doing their tasks, they can get support on gathering information by using the Bing browser, which even has its own AI-powered assistant named "Copilot." Users can then upload their work to other people using Outlook's email software or the Microsoft Teams app, and then immediately return to Office 365 to repeat the cycle of completing tasks. All while using the same personal/business professional accounts and avoiding using any other services outside of Microsoft.

    There are many more members in Microsoft's ecosystem which can be used in more varied situations. OpenAI for those who want an AI assistant with more capabilities than Copilot. LinkedIn for users that want to network with other business professionals and provide support in job searching. There are even advanced applications in the Microsoft Stack that can be major tools for data analysts and computer scientists.

    If users or organizations are using one product from Microsoft, there would always be 5-10 more products that are readily available to synergize with whichever task is being done. And since 83% of all companies are already using Office 365, it means that the majority of professional industries are well-aware of what Microsoft is and are likely able to try more of what Microsoft has to offer. Especially if their services complement each other. The healthy and diverse ecosystem, which other competitors have difficulty replicating, is a major contribution to Microsoft becoming sustainable and profitable.

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**: 
    As mentioned before, Microsoft developed and gained ownership of a wide variety of apps and services in their digital ecosystem. A portion of the digital ecosystem is the set of applications and tools that work with each other, known as the "Microsoft Stack."

    A few major applications in the Stack include:
    - **Microsoft Office 365**: A service that offers desktop features that make it easier to use their cloud-based applications. The service includes applications like MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.
    - **Microsoft Azure**: A collection of cloud services that enable users to design, test, deploy, and manage applications and services across a worldwide network using Microsoft-managed data centers.
    - **Microsoft Visual Studio**: A powerful and versatile integrated development environment (IDE) for software developers and teams. It provides users with a productive environment for accurately coding, debugging, and testing their applications.
    - **Microsoft SQL Server**: A database management system that uses encryption to offer credible server security. It manages several vital tasks like data retrieval, restoration, backup and recovery, storage, and more.
    - **Microsoft SharePoint**: A collaboration software tool that helps teams work together efficiently. The platform is entirely web-based, and it supports client-side and server-side development. It aids in simple integration with the page-and-part model and supports Microsoft Graph for open-source tooling.

## Landscape

* **What field is the company in?**: 
    Microsoft is a technological business company.

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5–10 years?**:
    1. Microsoft reached an agreement to acquire GitHub in 2018. The two partners planned to expand their community even further by soon creating tools with more power and acceleration. Along with ideas on making development tools more user-friendly for new audiences. This event became a major trend in the tech industry because the ownership of GitHub will soon solidify Microsoft's lead in the software development community.
    
    2. Microsoft released Azure Synapse Analytics in 2019. This new platform inherits the MPP database technology from Azure SQL Data Warehouse and upgraded it with many new features to make it the most powerful data analytics solution on the market. It centralized data analysts' various tools for smoother operation and better integration. It allowed the integration of Azure Synapse with Microsoft’s other cloud services, so users can make native connections from one Business Intelligence platform to many others. With the addition of more features, Azure Synapse Analytics became a major innovation to users of data analysis, Business Intelligence, and Machine Learning.

    3. Microsoft created Copilot, in 2023. It is an AI assistant that used to be exclusive to the Bing search engine, which is why it was formerly named "Bing Chat." But later, Microsoft renamed the program to Copilot as they made plans for it to expand further outside of being usable in Bing. Currently, the company created Copilot's own dedicated domain, and they've even implemented it into Office 365 apps and services. The flexibility in where you can use Copilot, as well as it being easily accessible and free for Microsoft users, helps Microsoft create a unique path to outcompete rival AI industries.

* **What are the other major companies in this field?**: 
    There is currently a huge number of competitors in the tech business industry due to technology having many different departments that serve varied functions. Since Microsoft is in a list of the most valuable tech companies, its major competitors are the following:
    - Apple
    - Alphabet (Google)
    - Amazon
    - Tesla
    - Meta Platforms (Facebook)

## Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**: 
    Microsoft has created an Annual Report listing all of their key accomplishments and impacts in 2023. Some of the most major events include:
    - Azure's recent expansions allowed server products and cloud services revenue to increase by 19%.
    - Growth in the global market, creation of new monetized solutions, and the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph allowed LinkedIn revenue to increase by 10%.
    - On the commercial side, Office products and cloud services revenue increased by 10% with Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%. For consumers, Office products and cloud services revenue increased by 2%, and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0 million. The new additions to the apps, such as the integration of Copilot AI and increased engagement in the cloud department, were main contributors to the growth of Microsoft 365.
    
    With these impactful events, along with many more, Microsoft reported earning $211.9 billion in 2023's total revenue.

* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?**: 
    Microsoft uses metrics to check their current performance on their business and use that information to make more decisions on resource allocation. The 2023 Annual Report lists the following as the important metrics:
    - Revenue
    - Gross margin
    - Operating income
    - Net income
    - Earnings Per Share

* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?**:
    In Q3 2023, Microsoft's Quarterly Growth Rates had increased by 12.76%. A huge growth rate compared to the other major competitors, mentioned above, except Alphabet 13.59%.

    Microsoft also gained an 8.44% share of the entire market in the 12-month period. Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon do have a higher market share of over 10% each. But Microsoft does have an edge compared to the other tech competitors, as many have a hard time exceeding 2%. In addition to Microsoft's recent key accomplishments and impacts providing a higher percentage of users, the company is positioned to rise significantly in market share, especially as they continue to invest and innovate in AI and cloud departments. 

## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**: 
    I am a user of Microsoft. I've been using Dell laptops, desktops, and Android phones for years. And I've chosen to be a Microsoft user because I favor its supremacy in the technical department compared to the products Apple is producing. But one thing that does bother me, in all the times I've used Microsoft products, is the fact that the laptops and desktops always have the Office 365 apps directly installed into their devices. But they are completely inaccessible unless you pay the subscription services of $7 per month or $70 per year.

    This backhanded strategy could encourage a handful of users to purchase Office 365 directly. But the majority of the time, it only causes frustration to everyone who's cautious with money. If it's possible for Office Online to perform well, the free version of Office 365 which can only be accessed on browsers, I believe in the possibility of taking what Office Online does well and putting that on the "freemium" Office 365 apps on desktop.

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**: 
    A major reason why it would benefit the company is because it doesn't have to compete with other companies' free versions of Office 365. It's true that Office Online is also free, but it's obsolete because it has many of its features locked behind a paywall. And its exclusivity on browsers means it has to compete with other alternatives found in browsers. Especially Google, since people can easily gain access to the Google series of 365 alternatives, such as Google Docs and Google Sheets. The Google series of browser alternatives have many of the features that the premium Office 365 has, while the features in Office Online are mostly locked behind a paywall. Office Online cannot compete with the Google apps in the browser market without the risk of many Office 365 users switching to the free version if it offers too much. 

    But one thing the Google apps do lack is the desktop versions of the apps. All of the Google apps are browser-exclusive, and it becomes a major inconvenience if desktop users download documents on their computers and cannot easily open them directly. For them to gain access to those files on the Google apps, they'd have to upload each file into Google Drive, and then open the files on their apps. And if you want to have those updated files on your desktop, you'd have to download each file from Google Drive. It may not be too bad for those who only want access to one file, but for those who want to check and open multiple files of varying functions, it becomes chaotic. The Google apps may be great alternatives to Office 365, but they are not able to completely replace them, especially for businesses that need to work with documents all the time.

    There is no other competitor in the desktop Office 365 department. Users would have to either buy 365 or find alternatives that wouldn't be able to fix all problems. I believe that the success of the Google apps would encourage Alphabet to create freemium desktop versions of Docs, Sheets, and Drive in the near future. So rather than having faith in the loyal 365 users and leaving the rest oblivious to their new features, Microsoft should take the structure of Office Online and make it the default apps for the Office apps.

    The risk of 365 subscribers turning to the free versions may cause some doubt in the plan, but there are still many monetizable features Microsoft can add to make up the cost. Similar to Office Online. As a reminder of the apps being freemium, they would always have a popup of "subscriptions are available for purchase" when starting each of them up for the first time. Features like using Copilot, increased cloud storage, advanced collaboration tools and security, and many more cannot be accessed without a subscription. Users that want to use features outside of the essential editing must pay for 365 to avoid making that service obsolete. If it's still not making enough money, freemium 365 could also place ads as long as they aren't too intrusive (people would go back to Google otherwise). To avoid users that want to defeat ads by going offline, Microsoft can also make it so while you can view documents offline, editing won't be allowed in freemium unless you're connected to the internet.

    While this idea may sound simple to discuss but difficult to implement, I believe that freemium desktop 365 can work and become a huge impact in the tech industry. There are too many features left out in freemium mode for companies and active 365 users to miss out. So I don't believe in the fear of a huge percentage of them avoiding the payment of premium 365. But for everyone else that wants desktop apps that do not become a financial concern, it would finally provide a way for that majority to have some form of access to 365 while being aware of all the features it has to offer. I never even knew Copilot was implemented in all Office applications until I've created this case study. And while it's a revolutionary decision, I and many others just weren't aware of that feature and many more of what 365 has to offer. The freemium 365 has great potential in gaining an edge in the tech market. Potential customers would use the freemium apps for a while, and finally be aware of the 1 TB of cloud storage, AI support, and advanced features not found in any alternatives. Making so many Microsoft users decide if all of these features are a great deal for $7 a month. Competitors would eventually find a way into the desktop app market, so I'm hopeful for Microsoft to start the innovation first by creating the freemium Office 365 apps for all Microsoft users.

* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**: 
    Some technologies that can help make freemium 365 monetizable and functional include Ad Deliveries, In-App Purchase Platforms, Improved Security Technology, and an Updated Feedback System.

* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**:
    - **Ad Deliveries**: Microsoft's freemium 365 would need to create a system that can consistently deliver ads that are functional, non-obtrusive, and lag-free. This is essential to avoid ruining the experience for freemium users while keeping them aware of what the ads have to offer. 
    - **In-App Purchase Platforms**: There must be a system that locks freemium users away from the premium features, without paying for a 365 subscription. It also must be able to guide interested users to the payment process of premium 365.
    - **Improved Security Technology**: With a much wider range of users, the security for 365 needs to be greatly improved to avoid all of the potential threats that new users might face. It must also be able to detect and deny access to illegally pirated 365 applications, in case freemium users would turn to them instead of paying for a subscription.
    - **Updated Feedback System**: A wide and new freemium crowd would always bring more opinions and suggestions to the 365 apps. Regardless if they're strictly using the free versions of 365, or they're new users of the premium version. Creating new surveys for this crowd can bring a ton of newly valuable information to the table.
